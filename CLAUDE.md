## Project Overview

**Bocchi The Map** is a location-based review application designed specifically for solo travelers and individuals who enjoy exploring places alone. The app helps users discover, review, and share spots that are comfortable and suitable for solo activities, with an interactive map interface and community-driven reviews.

This is a full-stack monorepo application built with modern technologies: Go backend with Onion Architecture, Next.js frontend, Terraform infrastructure, and comprehensive monitoring with New Relic and Sentry, designed to scale from monolith to microservices as needed.

## Knowledge Management Structure

This project systematically manages knowledge through the following files:

**Important**: The `.claude/` directory is a hidden directory. Use `bash ls -la .claude/` to verify file existence instead of the LS tool, which doesn't display hidden directories.

### Core Knowledge Files (`.claude/` directory)

#### `.claude/context.md`
- Project background, purpose, and constraints
- Technical stack selection rationale
- Business requirements and technical constraints

#### `.claude/project-knowledge.md`
- Implementation patterns and design decision insights
- Architecture selection rationale (see "Cloud Run & Monitoring Integration" section)
- Patterns to avoid and anti-patterns

#### `.claude/project-improvements.md`
- Records of past trial and error
- Failed implementations and their causes
- Improvement processes and results
- Latest implementation status (see "Cloud Run & Monitoring Integration Implementation (2025-06-29)" section)

#### `.claude/common-patterns.md`
- Frequently used command patterns
- Standard implementation templates
- Deployment commands (see "Cloud Run and Docker Deployment Patterns" section)

### Additional Documentation

#### `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md`
- Current system status and major achievements
- Implementation milestones tracking

#### `.github/actions/setup-go-test-env/README.md`
- Recent security, debugging, and migration improvements
- GitHub Actions configuration details

**Important**: When making new implementations or important decisions, please update the corresponding files.

## Development Principles

### Core Development Standards

- Follow BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) with Ginkgo framework
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability from project start
- Use Protocol Buffers for type-safe API contracts
- Follow Onion Architecture with clear dependency boundaries
- Prioritize security and performance in all implementations
