**Note**: All code comments and commit messages must be written in English as specified in the design principles below.

## Project Overview

**Bocchi The Map** is a location-based review application designed specifically for solo travelers and individuals who enjoy exploring places alone. The app helps users discover, review, and share spots that are comfortable and suitable for solo activities, with an interactive map interface and community-driven reviews.

This is a full-stack monorepo application built with modern technologies: Go backend with Onion Architecture, Next.js frontend with Auth0 authentication, Terraform infrastructure, and comprehensive monitoring with New Relic and Sentry, designed to scale from monolith to microservices as needed.

### Current Project Status (2025-07-11)

**Authentication Integration:** ‚úÖ **Production-Ready (97% Complete)**
- Auth0 integration fully implemented with JWT validation
- Comprehensive security features (CORS, rate limiting, input validation)
- E2E testing infrastructure with 18/20 tests passing (90% success rate)
- Ready for production deployment with configuration updates
- **Note**: Go build issues need resolution for 100% test success

**Development Environment:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partially Optimized**
- Enhanced tooling and debugging capabilities documented
- Comprehensive testing patterns established
- **Note**: VSCode configuration setup needed (`.vscode` directory missing)

## Knowledge Management Structure

This project systematically manages knowledge through the following files:

## Development Principles

### Core Development Standards

- Follow TDD+BDD Hybrid methodology with three distinct approaches
- Use BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) with Ginkgo framework for user-facing behavior
- Apply TDD (Test-Driven Development) for internal implementation details
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability from project start
- Use Protocol Buffers for type-safe API contracts
- Follow Onion Architecture with clear dependency boundaries
- Prioritize security and performance in all implementations

### Authentication & Security Standards

- **Auth0 Integration**: Production-ready authentication with JWT validation
- **Security-First Design**: CORS protection, rate limiting, and comprehensive input validation
- **Type-Safe Authentication**: Full TypeScript integration for auth flows
- **Comprehensive Testing**: E2E authentication testing with automated scripts

### Development Environment Standards

- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier integration for consistent code formatting
- **Testing Infrastructure**: TDD+BDD hybrid testing patterns with comprehensive coverage
- **Testing Methodology**: Outside-In development with BDD scenarios driving TDD implementation
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for setup, deployment, and troubleshooting
- **Note**: IDE optimization pending (VSCode configuration setup needed)

### TDD+BDD Hybrid Testing Guidelines

When implementing new features, follow the TDD+BDD hybrid methodology:

1. **Start with BDD** - Define user behavior with Given-When-Then scenarios
2. **Use TDD for Implementation** - Drive internal components with Red-Green-Refactor cycles
3. **Layer-Specific Approach** - BDD for interfaces, TDD for domain logic
4. **Reference Documentation** - Use `.claude/tdd-bdd-methodology.md` for theory, `.claude/tdd-bdd-implementation-guide.md` for patterns, and `.claude/tdd-bdd-examples.md` for concrete examples
5. **Update Templates** - Extend `.claude/common-patterns.md` with new testing patterns as needed

## Important Instruction Reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
