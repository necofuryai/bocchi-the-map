## Project Overview

**Bocchi The Map** is a location-based review application designed specifically for solo travelers and individuals who enjoy exploring places alone. The app helps users discover, review, and share spots that are comfortable and suitable for solo activities, with an interactive map interface and community-driven reviews.

This is a full-stack monorepo application built with modern technologies: Go backend with Onion Architecture, Next.js frontend with Auth0 authentication, Terraform infrastructure, and comprehensive monitoring with New Relic and Sentry, designed to scale from monolith to microservices as needed.

### Current Project Status (2025-06-30)

**Authentication Integration:** ‚úÖ **Production-Ready (97% Complete)**
- Auth0 integration fully implemented with JWT validation
- Comprehensive security features (CORS, rate limiting, input validation)
- E2E testing infrastructure with 33/34 tests passing
- Ready for production deployment with configuration updates

**Development Environment:** ‚úÖ **Optimized**
- VSCode configuration optimized for TypeScript development
- Enhanced tooling and debugging capabilities
- Comprehensive testing patterns established

## Knowledge Management Structure

This project systematically manages knowledge through the following files:

**Important**: The `.claude/` directory is a hidden directory. Use `bash ls -la .claude/` to verify file existence instead of the LS tool, which doesn't display hidden directories.

## Development Principles

### Core Development Standards

- Follow BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) with Ginkgo framework
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and observability from project start
- Use Protocol Buffers for type-safe API contracts
- Follow Onion Architecture with clear dependency boundaries
- Prioritize security and performance in all implementations

### Authentication & Security Standards

- **Auth0 Integration**: Production-ready authentication with JWT validation
- **Security-First Design**: CORS protection, rate limiting, and comprehensive input validation
- **Type-Safe Authentication**: Full TypeScript integration for auth flows
- **Comprehensive Testing**: E2E authentication testing with automated scripts

### Development Environment Standards

- **IDE Optimization**: VSCode configured for optimal TypeScript development
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier integration for consistent code formatting
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Automated testing patterns with high coverage
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for setup, deployment, and troubleshooting
